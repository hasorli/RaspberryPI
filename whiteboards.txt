NOTES ON LINUX AND INTERACTIVE WHITE BOARDS


Looks like we need to use 

evdev - EVent DEVice

this is a set of drivers 

events register as keyboard / mouse events

man page info http://en.digipedia.org/man/doc/view/evdev.4/

plug in and type lsusb to see if device is listed

run dmesg to see if it is detected by the kernel

dmesg /dev/input

xorg will work with smartboards

xserver-xorg-input-evdev
